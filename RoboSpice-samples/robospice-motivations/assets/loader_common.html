Loaders have been designed to handle SQLLite database cursors. And they do it well. They are able to 
<ul>
  <li> follow any change in the data source and update the ui automatically
  <li> avoid recycling a cursor from an instance of an activity to another one, 
  the cursor is passed between activities, and this is much faster, and doesn't impact 
  the UI thread at all has the connection to the database is kept alive.
</ul>
