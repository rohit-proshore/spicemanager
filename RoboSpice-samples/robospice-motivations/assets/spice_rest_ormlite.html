<h2>Play with this demo</h2>

<p>
This demo is exactly the same as the previous Demo : a REST client looking for new Tweets about Android.
</p>

<p>
The only difference is that we don't store the Tweets in cache using JSON, but we use ORM Lite to store them in a SQLite Database.
</p>

<p>
All mapping and table creations are handled automatically by RoboSpice.

We provide additional examples of RoboSpice capabilities in the next Activities...
